  > Listening to music while I study makes me focus on things at hand. I always listen to different radio stations all over the world. So, I took a challenge to build a website that allows the user to listen to any FM Radio stations all over the world. 

  > One note that I would like to stress out in this project is that, FM Radio websites streams their live music on different audio formats. Some follows the web standards while others are still using the old audio formats which may or may not work on the users machine.

  > I always wanted to build a news website as a pet project. I took this challenge and build this website in a different level. After doing a lot of research, I found [The Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) as a good api source to play around with and started building this project. The good thing about this api is that it doesn't need any apikey but it takes a little time to return data.

### Overview :sunglasses:

[View project source code](https://github.com/Aimanski12/ReactJS_Projects/tree/proj04).

I wanted to make an application that renders [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) so I made this application that renders maps on a mobile device. I had so much fun building this application and I learned how to render map components using `MapView` and the properties that are needed for the map to render. I also learned how to create map markers using `MapView.Marker` and animate the markers when a new location is selected. I also learned how to `Polygons` and `Polylines`. This can be very useful for projects that needs map components.

<summary><strong>29. Animations of React Native</strong></summary>

### Overview :sunglasses:
I was playing with `React Native Animation` library for this project and I learned a lot from it. In this project I learned configure animation using `Animate.timing()` and how to compose animation methods. I also explored how to combine animations values and how to modify the segments of the animation using `interpolate()` and use it to built in methods like `transform`, `translate`, `scale`.

This challenge deepens my understanding of `Navigation` functions of [React Native Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) version 3.x. Creating tabs using `creareStackNavigator`, `createSwitchNavigator`, `createBottomTabNavigator`, `createAppContainer`, and `createDrawerNavigator` are some of the few things I was exploring in this project.
