## Currency Converter in full Website

> In this project, I have created a full website application from the currency app that I have created on the two project. This website is fully responsive and it is also using the [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) to its navigation. This webapp is also using [API Frankfurter](https://www.frankfurter.app/) and [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) APIs.
I also sketched designed the app using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
